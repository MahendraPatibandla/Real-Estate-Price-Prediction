# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

# Overview:
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning algorithms. The objective is to create an accurate and user-friendly web application where users can input property features and receive a price prediction.

# Tools & Technologies:
Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Flask: For developing the web application.
Dataset: Real estate data including features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc.

# Key Features:
Predictive Model: Trained on historical real estate data to predict property prices.
Web Application: User-friendly interface built with Flask, allowing users to input property details and receive price predictions in real-time.
Data Visualization: Visual representations of data distributions and feature importance to improve model interpretability.

# How to Run:
Clone the repository and install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to understand the data preprocessing and model training steps.
Start the Flask server by running server.py.
Access the web application through your local server and input property details to get predictions.
